This is a simple application allows to discover dogs' breed. There is a list of breeds and each time we get a picture of a particular breed to illustrate.

### _Description_

`PickerView` was used for a convenience of a user to have a list of breeds and choose among them.
PickerView is populated by the list of breeds by API.

The API which was used to complete this project is: https://dog.ceo/api/

At first there was a request for a random image, and later was more specified for a particular breed request.

There is also a possibility to reload with a `reload` button to see another picture of the same breed requested. 
Each time the `reload` button is pressed it generates another image as per the example above.
